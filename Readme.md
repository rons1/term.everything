## Run every GUI app in the terminal!

## Even over ssh!
Behold as I play a [video game in a font](https://github.com/mmulet/font-game-engine) in a web browser in a terminal transmitted over ssh (with one hand tied behind my back)!

### Read about how it works!
Check out [HowIDidIt.md](./resources/HowIDidIt.md)

## More Examples
The quality of the window is limited to the number of rows and columns in your
terminal. If you increase the resolution (ctrl - in alacritty, check your
terminal) the quality will go up, (but performance may go down).

Here I open up the Wing It! movie, and increase the quality until I get both
a good frame rate and resolution:

![increase resolution](./resources/graphics/show_increase_res.gif)

----------------

If your terminal supports images (like [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/)
or [iterm2](https://iterm2.com/)) you can render windows at full resolution
(performance may degrade).

In this example, on my mac, I open iTerm2 ssh into ubuntu and open firefox
at full resolution:

I feel like every single day I hear about another terminal file viewer. I say, stop making terminal file viewers because you can just use the file viewer you already have! In your terminal!

Terminal in a terminal in a terminal in a terminal in a terminal.... it's terminals all the way down.

With only a small amount hacking, it can run Doom (shareware episode)!

Run an entire Desktop in your terminal!
[@ismail-yilmaz](https://github.com/ismail-yilmaz) is running Firefox, on [KDE Neon](https://neon.kde.org) in a [VM](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-boxes) on [Bobcat](https://github.com/ismail-yilmaz/Bobcat)

And this isn't even full resolution! Checkout the [full vid in in the discussions](https://github.com/mmulet/term.everything/discussions/16#discussioncomment-14390137)

## About
`term.everything❗` is a Linux CLI program to run GUI windows in your terminal. Specifically, `term.everything❗` is a built-from-scratch [Wayland](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Wayland) compositor that outputs to a terminal rather than your monitor.

>Don't know what Wayland is or just want to know more about how this works? Then, head over to [HowIDidIt.md](./resources/HowIDidIt.md) where I will explain how everything works in detail.
